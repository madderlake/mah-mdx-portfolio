Headless WordPress / NextJS Theme I have been a fan of the headless CMS since it
first became a "thing", and using WordPress was especially intriguing. For many
years, and on countless WordPress sites, I have managed and updated an exploding
number of plugins, themes, and files, ever watchful for potential security
vulnerabilities.

I have always seen WordPress as a platform, probably because I have used it for
sites, and not exclusively for blogging. When stripped of the functionality that
delivers the content to the browser, you are left with a pretty lean, mean
content entry and delivery machine.

All this is in addition to the burgeoning popularity of libraries like React and
statically generated sites, not to mention the increasing need for optimization,
performance, and security.

This project is built on WordPress with React, NextJS, Typescript, and GraphQL.
Local development was set up with Docker and the front end was bootstrapped with
create-next-app.

### My Requirements

- Built from scratch

- Boilerplate - minimal styles - customizable

- ACF Page Templates - integrate Flexible content page Templates

- TailwindCSS - explore this utility-first style system for the first time

- Blog and Archive pages that allow introductory content

### Headless with ACF

For a previous headless theme, I had converted an ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)
template to React, along with several layout components - tabs, columns, and
cards. I wanted to include this page template in my headless theme, and load it
conditionally.

I was excited to take a deep dive into server components - included with Next as
of v13. It's a huge shift that moves React into fullstack territory.

### Challenges & Gotchas

- setting up Types for GraphQL data (nodes and edges)
- composing the `GraphQL query` to get all the ACF data
- 500 errors resulting from nested data fetching for the statically rendered
  pages.

### Repository & Further Detail

You can see how I solved these issues in the
