When I contacted the owner of this juice and cleanse company after noticing that
it had totally lost its charm, the owner shared her frustrations with the new
design and recurring site outages. We agreed to work together to bring her brand
back to life.

I moved the site to my hosting platform, deactivated the problematic plugins,
and implemented a new theme. After securing some of the original assets from the
previous designer, I refreshed the branding, restoring the original colors and
identity.

## Features & Technologies

- **WooCommerce**: ecommerce for WordPress with a custom theme built atop their
  Storefront theme.
- **ACF**: Page templates with flexible content layouts and components.
- **Design**: Figma, Sketch, and Photoshop.

## Prologue

We were a punch list away from launching the new site when we both had to step
away for personal reasons. When we resumed contact, she had sold the business.
The new owner did not want to invest in the rebranded design and moved the site
to another platform. It is currently archived on my domain.
