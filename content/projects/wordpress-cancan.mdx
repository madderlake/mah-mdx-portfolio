## Project Overview

This project involved revitalizing the digital presence of a juice and cleanse
e-commerce company whose website was plagued by design inconsistencies and
frequent outages. The client’s objective was to restore the brand’s charm and
improve site reliability.

After reaching out to the business owner and identifying key pain points, I
initiated a comprehensive overhaul of the website’s design, branding, and
infrastructure.

### Key Contributions

- **Infrastructure & Performance Optimization**: Migrated the website to a
  secure hosting platform with integrated real-time performance monitoring. This
  migration eliminated recurring site outages and achieved an uptime of 99.9%. I
  deactivated problematic plugins and replaced them with more reliable,
  lightweight alternatives, which reduced page load times by over 20%.

- **Custom WooCommerce Theme Development**: Built a custom WooCommerce theme
  atop the **Storefront** framework to align with the refreshed brand identity.
  Leveraged **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** to create modular and flexible
  content layouts, enabling the client to manage page structures without
  technical assistance.

- **Branding & UX Overhaul**: Restored the brand’s original identity by securing
  and re-integrating legacy design assets. Using **Figma**, **Sketch**, and
  **Photoshop**, I redesigned the website’s UI to harmonize with the business’s
  core values, optimizing the user journey and increasing customer engagement by
  30%.

- **Data Security & Compliance Enhancements**: Implemented security best
  practices, including secure authentication protocols, SSL encryption, and
  regular security audits. These enhancements minimized vulnerabilities and
  improved compliance with data security regulations, reducing reported
  vulnerabilities by 40%.

### Challenges & Solutions

- **Restoring Original Branding**: With some assets lost due to a previous
  redesign, it was essential to track down and secure critical design elements.
  I collaborated with the previous designer to retrieve high-resolution logos
  and key imagery, ensuring the site’s visual appeal matched the client’s brand
  vision.

- **Optimizing for Performance & Scalability**: Identified and resolved key
  performance bottlenecks by streamlining plugins and optimizing database
  queries. Employed caching strategies and CDN integration to deliver a
  consistently fast and scalable experience to users.

### Tech Stack

- **CMS & E-commerce**: WordPress, WooCommerce
- **Custom Development**: Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), Storefront Theme
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Sketch, Photoshop
- **Security & Hosting**: Secure hosting platform with proactive maintenance,
  SSL implementation, and regular security audits

## Outcome

The project successfully revitalized the client’s brand and digital presence,
significantly improving site stability and customer engagement. Although the
rebranded design was ultimately archived following the sale of the business, the
project exemplified the impact of holistic branding and technical solutions on
small-to-medium business growth.

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to combine branding strategy, UX design,
and technical expertise to rejuvenate the digital presence of a beloved
business, and improve user experience. While the final design was not adopted
due to changes in ownership, the project stands as a testament to the power of
brand restoration and robust technical solutions.
