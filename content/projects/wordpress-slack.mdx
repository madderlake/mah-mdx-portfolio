As a member of the Growth team at Slack, I collaborated with a small team to
integrate a headless version of WordPress into the Resources section. Our goals
were to empower content creators to produce content independently and uphold
Slack's brand standards.

I was tasked with developing a theming system using CSS variables, allowing
content creators to customize styles with nine colorways across all components.

As part of this project, the navigation system for the main site had been
redesigned to add more content links. I took on the task of rebuilding it,
consolidating navigation info in a single data file, and delivering it via a
recursive Hack function.

This update totally transformed the process for maintaining the nav, from an
error-prone manual process that required copy edits to several files, to one
that required quick data update to the navigation library.

## Features

- **Components**: Built in ACF, selectable by content creators.
- **Custom Theming**: Nine distinct color themes.
- **Internationalizaton**: Backend content delivery to translation sytem.
- **WordPress VIP**: Hosting service, with all code debugged, refactored, and
  approved.

## Tech Stack

- **WordPress**: CMS
- **ACF**: Custom fields for WordPress, on steroids.
- **Javascript**: Page interactions, scrolling and time-based
  Internationalizaton.
- **Hack**: A typed version of PHP.

## Conclusion

This was an intense project, and launched in the months prior to the pandemic,
when an explosion of content was required to address all things remote work.
