As Lead Developer for Product at Cengage Learning, I was tasked with building a
new website for our team, Creative Studio, to showcase our services to
stakeholders. Following Cengage's brand guidelines, I designed, built, and wrote
the content for this internal site.

It was fun to have the opportunity to create the home page video from scratch
and to use mini-videos for each team member, as it brought life to the site.

The ACF flexible content templates I developed at PagerDuty came in handy,
incorporating new layouts such as tabs and sliders.

TECH: WordPress, Advanced Custom Fields Pro ACF, Custom Post Types, Javascript,
Adobe After Effects

## Conclusion

A few months after this project launched, Cengage closed its San Francisco
offices. I have archived the site on my domain, as it was an internal site, not
available to the public.
