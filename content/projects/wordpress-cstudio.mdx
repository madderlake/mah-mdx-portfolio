## Empowering Internal Creatives

As the Lead Developer for Product at Cengage Learning, I was responsible for
building a new website for the Creative Studio team to effectively showcase our
services to internal stakeholders. The objective was to highlight the teamâ€™s
capabilities and creativity while adhering to Cengage's strict brand guidelines.

I led the entire project lifecycleâ€”from conceptual design to final
deploymentâ€”and developed dynamic elements to bring a more engaging and
interactive experience to the platform.

### Key Contributions

- **Custom Video Production & Integration**: Created the homepageâ€™s dynamic
  video header using **Adobe After Effects**. The video was designed to
  introduce the Creative Studio teamâ€™s offerings with a vibrant and engaging
  narrative. Additionally, I produced mini-videos for each team member, giving
  the site a personalized and lively feel. This multimedia approach effectively
  communicated the teamâ€™s creativity and collaborative spirit.

- **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Pro Development**: Leveraging my expertise with
  ACF from previous projects, I developed flexible content templates that
  allowed non-technical stakeholders to update and manage the site easily. These
  templates included various custom layouts such as **tabbed sections**,
  **interactive sliders**, and **media galleries**, making it simple to present
  information in an engaging way.

- **Custom Post Types & Content Architecture**: Implemented custom post types
  for managing team profiles, project portfolios, and service offerings, which
  streamlined content updates and allowed for future scalability. This approach
  ensured consistency across all pages and reduced dependency on hardcoded
  layouts.

- **JavaScript Interactivity & UX Enhancements**: Utilized JavaScript for adding
  interactivity and animations to elements like sliders, video overlays, and
  tabbed navigation. This added layer of engagement enhanced the user experience
  and aligned with Cengageâ€™s high standards for quality and design.

### Challenges & Solutions

- **Adhering to Strict Brand Guidelines**: Worked closely with the branding and
  marketing teams to ensure all site elements were in strict compliance with
  Cengageâ€™s brand guidelines. This included precise color schemes, typography,
  and multimedia formats to maintain brand integrity.

- **Dynamic & Flexible Content Management**: By designing modular ACF templates
  and custom post types, I allowed for future-proofed content updates and
  extended site functionality without the need for additional development, thus
  empowering the internal team to manage updates autonomously.

### Tech Stack

- **CMS**: WordPress with Advanced Custom Fields Pro (ACF)
- **Custom Development**: Custom Post Types, JavaScript, and PHP-based templates
- **Multimedia Production**: Adobe After Effects
- **Design & Branding**: Figma for initial wireframes and design compliance

## Outcome

The new Creative Studio website successfully showcased the teamâ€™s talents and
services while maintaining consistency with Cengageâ€™s brand standards. The
incorporation of personalized video elements and interactive components made the
site more engaging and visually appealing. This project highlighted the value of
combining technical development with multimedia production to create a
compelling stakeholder experience.

## Conclusion

Although Cengage eventually closed its San Francisco offices, the site is still
active internally. I have archived it on my domain for posterity. ðŸ˜‰
