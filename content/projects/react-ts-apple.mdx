## Project Overview

The Platform team at Apple was tasked with building a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for
a transformative upgrade to Apple’s marketing website, migrating the site to a
CMS-driven architecture using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) in a headless
configuration. The project’s goal was to significantly streamline the content
management process and improve design consistency across platforms.

My primary focus was on bringing advanced expertise in React, TypeScript, and
Next.js to a team transitioning to these technologies. I led the development of
complex, reusable UI components and contributed to the foundational architecture
that made this transformation possible.

### Key Contributions

- **Developed Modular & Responsive Components**: One key example was the **Image
  Accordion** component, a complex feature designed to maintain visual
  consistency and optimize performance across different devices by utilizing a
  single responsive image asset. I implemented adaptive logic to handle
  viewport-specific interactions and layout changes efficiently using React
  Hooks and responsive styling techniques.

- **Pioneered Type-Safe Integration with CMS**: I spearheaded the integration of
  strictly typed data using **TypeBox** and **JSON Schema**, enforcing a
  type-safe conduit between AEM and our React components. This approach
  minimized runtime errors and improved developer experience by leveraging
  TypeScript's static analysis capabilities. It was critical in meeting a key
  stakeholder deadline two weeks ahead of schedule.

- **Built an Atomic Component Library**: I developed the architecture and
  testing strategies for an **atomic design system**. This ensured that
  components adhered to Apple’s high standards and were consistent across
  platforms. I employed Storybook for isolated component testing and Cucumber
  for BDD testing, reducing post-release revisions and improving design
  consistency.

- **Optimized Development Workflows & Collaboration**: Collaborated with
  cross-functional teams, including backend, design, accessibility, and SEO
  specialists, to deliver high-fidelity components from wireframes to
  production. This collaborative process led to a 30% reduction in component
  release cycles and the team’s highest merged PR count.

### Challenges & Solutions

- **Adapting to Enterprise-Level CMS Requirements**: Building components for an
  enterprise-level CMS like AEM required extensive coordination and scrupulous
  attention to detail. I implemented data validation and schema-based
  configurations to ensure that non-technical content editors could seamlessly
  populate complex components without introducing errors.

- **Ensuring Accessibility & SEO Standards**: We tackled challenges around
  accessibility and SEO optimization by conducting frequent audits and using
  internal tools for automated accessibility checks. I integrated ARIA roles and
  dynamic metadata generation to align the front-end with Apple’s accessibility
  and SEO guidelines.

### Key Learnings

- Mastered building a **type-safe React component system** tailored for
  integration with a headless CMS, leveraging TypeScript and schema-based
  validation.
- Developed an appreciation for rigorous **design standards** and the value of
  cross-functional collaboration in achieving a unified, high-quality product.
- Deepened knowledge of **responsive design** patterns and the use of advanced
  state management techniques in React.

### Tech Stack

- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Schema Management**: TypeBox, JSON Schema
- **Testing Tools**: Cucumber, Storybook
- **CMS**: Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
- **Other**: Apple internal tools for accessibility, analytics, and deployment

## Conclusion

This project was a highly rewarding experience that allowed me to contribute to
Apple’s digital transformation efforts. I had the opportunity to lead the final
push to load type-safe data from the CMS and present the PoC to stakeholders,
showcasing the platform’s capabilities and demonstrating our vision for future
development.
