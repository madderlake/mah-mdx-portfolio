The Platform team at Apple was tasked with building a Proof-of-Concept as the
basis for a consequential transformation of their marketing website.

Several of us were brought in to help bring advanced React development skills
and experience, as React was new to the team.

An example of the components I built was the `Image Accordion` component and
section, as seen below. The complexity here comes from the differences in how it
works on mobile devices, and using a single image for all viewports.

## Key Learnings

- Building an react component system to be consumed by an enterprise-level
  content management system, with all the scrupulous detail and coordination
  that required.
- How to configure components to enforce a type safe data conduit to the CMS.
- The value of Typescript - I learned to love it! ðŸ˜¬
- Working with incredibly high design standards
- The value of true collaboration with experts in design, backend,
  accessibility, SEO and QA.

## Tech Stack

- React
- NextJS
- Typescript
- TypeBox, JSON Schema
- Cucumber
- Apple internal tools

## Conclusion

This was an very rewarding project. I was fortunate to be given the opportunity
to lead the final push to load actual (type safe) data from the CMS to present
to stakeholders.
