This collaboration with the Lead Web Developer aimed to modernize the WordPress
instance. This included establishing a CI/CD process, deploying the site for
WPEngine, updating the styling with the Foundation framework, and building
dynamic page templates for various stakeholders.

I was tasked with building page templates using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to
meet the diverse needs of marketing, web, and development teams.

The migration process took several months due to the extensive culling of
hundreds of pages for relevance and duplication. Ultimately, we achieved a
significant performance score improvement, and the new templates empowered
stakeholders to manage content independently, optimizing development resources.

## Prologue

This project preceeded a huge growth period for PagerDuty, and the site we built
is still in use today, albeit in a headless instance, where Foundation has been
augmented by Tailwind CSS.
