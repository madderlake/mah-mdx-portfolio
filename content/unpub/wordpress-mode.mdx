Mode Studios is an interactive agency based in Seattle. I worked for them in the
summer of 2021, when the pandemic was curtailing in-person events, which is the
specialty of this agency. They were able to pivot to help their clients adapt to
this extraordinary environment by finding solutions in web development.

## WBEC Pacific

WBEC Pacific, a branch of WBENC, empowers women business owners through
networking events. When in-person gatherings were halted during the pandemic,
their operations were at risk.

We revitalized the online community by building a virtual events system within
their community platform, integrating a Zoom plugin and a chat application to
enable attendee communication.

Their annual event, "Ideation", was a smashing success, with a record number of
new community registrations.

## PG&E Learning

When PG\&E needed a community platform for its free courses, they came to Mode
Studios. After we built out the course system with LearnDas it did not have the
level of engagement that they envisioned. The solution was a community platform,
built in BuddyPress Pro, for students to communicate with their instructors and
other students. The result was a three-fold increase in course enrollments.

### Features & Technologies

  executives to interact for the benefit of all.
- **Learning Platform**: Built with LearnDash, with customizations.

## Conclusion

It was very gratifying to work on these projects. Not only were we able to help
these customers through a difficult period, the agency was also able to ride out
the storm, and is now back to their normal activities "creates interactive,
narrative, and personalized activations and installations that generate
excitement, and audience investment."
