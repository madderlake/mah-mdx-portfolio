When PG\&E needed a learning system for its free courses on vendor and supply
chain management, they came to us (Mode Studios). After we integrated Learn Dash
to build out the course system with LearnDash, it did not have the level of
engagement that they envisioned.

The solution was a community platform, built in BuddyPress Pro and integrated
with the learning system, for students to communicate with their instructors and
other students. The result was a three-fold increase in course enrollments.

### Features & Technologies

- **Community**: Also built with BuddyPress Pro to enable members, mentors and
  executives to interact for the benefit of all.
- **Learning Platform**: Built with LearnDash, with customizations.

## Conclusion

PG&E's learning modules are currently in high demand. For students, the ability
to connect and have discussions with instructors has made all the difference.
