Setting up a local WordPress development environment with Docker is an excellent
way to streamline your workflow - and save space on your hard drive!

If you've ever struggled with XXAMP, MAMP, or trying to re-configure PHP and
Apache on your Mac after a new release of Mac OS, you know there has to be a
better way.

Docker helps you avoid system dependency issues and ensures a consistent
development environment.

This guide will walk you through setting up a basic WordPress development
environment using Docker Desktop and `docker-compose`.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed on your system
- Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of Docker and WordPress

#### Step 1: Create a Project Directory

Start by creating a directory for your WordPress project:

```bash

mkdir wordpress-docker cd wordpress-docker

```

#### Step 2: Create an .env File In your project root directory, create a new file called

```bash
touch .env

```

Open the file and define the variables you'll need to access WordPress and
MySQL.

Example `.env` file:

```yaml
# MySQL configuration

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=example

# WordPress configuration

WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db:3306 WORDPRESS_DB_USER=root WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=example
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress

```

### Step 3: Create `docker-compose.yml`

The heart of the Docker setup is the `docker-compose.yml` file, which defines
the services for WordPress, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin.

Create that file inside your project directory:

```bash

touch docker-compose.yml

```

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  database:
    # Use a mariadb image which supports both amd64 & arm64 architecture
    image: mariadb:10.6.4-focal
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 3309:3306
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: '${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}'
      MYSQL_DATABASE: '${MYSQL_DATABASE}'
      MYSQL_USER: '${MYSQL_USER}'
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: '${MYSQL_PASSWORD}'
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - wordpress-network
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 2048m

  phpmyadmin:
    depends_on:
      - database
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8006:80
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: database
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: '${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}'
    networks:
      - wordpress-network

  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - database
    image: wordpress:6.6.1-apache
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8086:80
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: database
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: '${MYSQL_DATABASE}'
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: '${MYSQL_USER}'
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: '${MYSQL_PASSWORD}'
    volumes:
      - ./wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content

    networks:
      - wordpress-network

  volumes:
    db-data:
```

### Breakdown of `docker-compose.yml`

- **wordpress**: This is the WordPress container that uses the latest WordPress
  image from Docker Hub. We expose port `8080` for local access.

- **db**: This service runs a MariaDB container, defining environment variables
  for database access.

- **phpmyadmin**: phpMyAdmin is included for easier database management. Here it
  will run on port `8081`.

- **volumes**: this is where local directories are mapped to the files in the
  container. In this case we are mapping to the only folder we'll need to
  modify - `wp-content`

This directory needs to be inside the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml`

### Step 3: Create the Required Directories

You will need a local directory to hold WordPress files. This will sync with the
WordPress container so that you can make edits on your local machine.

```bash

mkdir wordpress

```

### Step 4: Start the Containers

With your `docker-compose.yml` file and project directories in place, you’re
ready to spin up the containers:

```bash

docker-compose up -d

```

This command runs the containers in the background (`-d` flag for detached
mode). Docker will pull the necessary images, set up the containers, and start
WordPress, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin.

### Step 5: Access WordPress and phpMyAdmin

Once the containers are up, you can access your local WordPress installation by
navigating to:

- WordPress: http://localhost:8080
- phpMyAdmin: http://localhost:8081 (logging with `root` / `example`)

### Step 6: Manage WordPress Files

Since the `wordpress` directory is mounted inside the container as a volume, any
changes you make to the files inside this directory will be reflected
immediately in the running WordPress instance.

You can edit the WordPress themes, plugins, or core files directly.

For example, if you’re developing a custom theme, you can create a theme
directory:

```bash

mkdir -p wordpress/wp-content/themes/my-custom-theme

```

And start building your theme inside `my-custom-theme`.

### Step 7: Stop and Remove Containers

When you’re done with your development session, you can stop the containers
with:

```bash

docker-compose down

```

This will stop and remove the containers, but your data (like the WordPress
database) will be preserved because it is stored in a Docker volume (`db_data`).

If you want to clean up everything, including the data, you can run:

```bash

docker-compose down -v

```

This will remove the containers and the associated volumes.

### Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to MySQL**: Ensure that the environment variables in the
  `docker-compose.yml` for both WordPress and MySQL are correctly aligned.
- **Port conflicts**: If port `8080` or `8081` is already in use, change the
  ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Conclusion

You now have a fully functional local WordPress development environment using
Docker! With `docker-compose`, it's easy to start and stop your environment,
ensuring that your development setup is reproducible and isolated. You can
expand this setup by adding more services, such as Redis or Elasticsearch, as
your project grows.

Happy coding!
