## Building a Progress Bar Component in React

Let's walk through how to build a simple, reusable ProgressBar component using
React. The component will visually represent a progress value between 0 and 100%
and will handle out-of-range values by clamping them to the nearest valid value.

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have the following set up:

**Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.<br/> **React**: Basic
understanding of React components and props.<br/> **Text Editor**: A code editor
like Visual Studio Code.

### What We're Building

The component takes two props `increment` and `duration`, which are set here to
`10` and `1000` respectively.

<ProgressBar duration={1000} />

### Step 1: Set Up the Project Create a new React project:

If you don't have a React project already, you can create one using Create React
App by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app progress-bar-example cd progress-bar-example
```

Navigate to the source folder: Inside your project directory, go to the src
folder where you'll add your ProgressBar component.

```bash
cd src
```

### Step 2: Create the ProgressBar Component

#### Create a new file for the ProgressBar component

create a file named `ProgressBar.js` inside the src directory:

```bash copy code
touch ProgressBar.js
```

#### Implement the ProgressBar component:

Open `ProgressBar.js` in your code editor and add the following code:

```javascript
const MIN = 0
const MAX = 100
const MIN = 0
const MAX = 100
```

```javascript
export default function ProgressBar({ increment = 20, duration = 1000 }) {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setProgress(prev => {
        if (prev >= 100) {
          clearInterval(intervalId)
          return 100
        } else {
          return prev + increment
        }
      })
    }, duration)
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className='progress' data-label={progress}>
      <span className='value' style={{ width: `${progress}%` }}>
        {progress > 0 && `${progress}%`}
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here's what each part of the code does:

- **MIN and MAX constants**: Define the minimum and maximum values for the
  progress bar (0% and 100%, respectively).

- **clampedValue**: Ensures the value prop is clamped between 0 and 100. If the
  value is less than MIN, it's set to MIN. If it's greater than MAX, it's set to
  MAX.
- **JSX structure**: The ProgressBar component returns a div with a nested div
  styled according to the clamped progress value.
- **Aria attributes**: The role and aria attributes ensure accessibility.

### Step 3: Styling

Add some basic styles to your ProgressBar component to make it visually
appealing. You can do this in a new ProgressBar.css file:

```bash
touch ProgressBar.css
```

Open ProgressBar.css and add the following CSS:

```css
.progress {
  background-color: #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  height: 20px;
  width: 100%;
}

.progress-bar {
  background-color: #76c7c0;
  height: 100%;
  transition: width 0.4s ease;
}

/* -- notes
.progress: Styles the container with a light gray background and rounded corners.
.progress-bar: Styles the inner bar with a custom color and smooth
transition effect as it changes width.*/
```

#### Import the CSS into your ProgressBar component:

Modify the ProgressBar.js file to import the CSS file:

```javascript
import './ProgressBar.css'
```

### Step 4: Use the ProgressBar Component

Open App.js in the src directory, and replace the default content with code that
uses your ProgressBar component:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import ProgressBar from './ProgressBar'

import ProgressBar from './progress-bar'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className='wrapper'>
      <ProgressBar increment={10} duration={1000} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **useState Hook**: Manages the state of the progress value.
- **input range slider**: Allows you to dynamically update the progress value
  and see the progress bar adjust in real time.

### Step 5: Run Your Application

Start the development server to see your progress bar in action:

```bash
npm start
```

Open the application: Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You
should see a simple progress bar that updates its value as you move the range
slider.

### Conclusion

Now you have a reusable and responsive ProgressBar component in React! Feel free
to customize the styles or enhance its functionality as needed.
