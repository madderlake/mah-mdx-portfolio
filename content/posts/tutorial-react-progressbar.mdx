## Building a Progress Bar Component in React

Let's walk through how to build a simple, reusable ProgressBar component using
React. The component will visually represent a progress value between 0 and 100%
and will handle out-of-range values by clamping them to the nearest valid value.

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have the following set up:

**Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.<br/> **React**: Basic
understanding of React components and props.<br/> **Text Editor**: A code editor
like Visual Studio Code.

### Step 1: Set Up the Project Create a new React project:

If you don't have a React project already, you can create one using Create React
App by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app progress-bar-example cd progress-bar-example
```

Navigate to the source folder: Inside your project directory, go to the src
folder where you'll add your ProgressBar component.

```bash
cd src
```

### Step 2: Create the ProgressBar Component

#### Create a new file for the ProgressBar component

create a file named `ProgressBar.js` inside the src directory:

```bash copy code
touch ProgressBar.js
```

#### Implement the ProgressBar component:

Open `ProgressBar.js` in your code editor and add the following code:

```javascript
const MIN = 0
const MAX = 100
const MIN = 0
const MAX = 100
```

```javascript
export default function ProgressBar({ value }) {
  // Handle invalid values and convert them to be within [0, 100].
  const clampedValue = Math.min(Math.max(value, MIN), MAX)

  return (
    <div className='progress'>
      {' '}
      <div
        className='progress-bar'
        style={{ width: `${clampedValue}%` }}
        role='progressbar'
        aria-valuenow={clampedValue}
        aria-valuemin={MIN}
        aria-valuemax={MAX}
      >
        {clampedValue}%{' '}
      </div>{' '}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here's what each part of the code does:

- **MIN and MAX constants**: Define the minimum and maximum values for the
  progress bar (0% and 100%, respectively).

- **clampedValue**: Ensures the value prop is clamped between 0 and 100. If the
  value is less than MIN, it's set to MIN. If it's greater than MAX, it's set to
  MAX.
- **JSX structure**: The ProgressBar component returns a div with a nested div
  styled according to the clamped progress value.
- **Aria attributes**: The role and aria attributes ensure accessibility.

### Step 3: Styling the ProgressBar

Add some basic styles to your ProgressBar component to make it visually
appealing. You can do this in a new ProgressBar.css file:

```bash
touch ProgressBar.css
```

Open ProgressBar.css and add the following CSS:

```css
.progress {
  background-color: #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
  height: 20px;
  width: 100%;
}

.progress-bar {
  background-color: #76c7c0;
  height: 100%;
  transition: width 0.4s ease;
}

/* -- notes
.progress: Styles the container with a light gray background and rounded corners.
.progress-bar: Styles the inner bar with a custom color and smooth
transition effect as it changes width.*/
```

#### Import the CSS into your ProgressBar component:

Modify the ProgressBar.js file to import the CSS file:

```javascript
import './ProgressBar.css'
```

### Step 4: Use the ProgressBar Component

Open App.js in the src directory, and replace the default content with code that
uses your ProgressBar component:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import ProgressBar from './ProgressBar'

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50)

  return (
    <div className='App'>
      {' '}
      <h1>React Progress Bar Example</h1>
      <ProgressBar value={value} />{' '}
      <input
        type='range'
        min='0'
        max='100'
        value={value}
        onChange={e => setValue(Number(e.target.value))}
      />{' '}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

- **useState Hook**: Manages the state of the progress value.
- **input range slider**: Allows you to dynamically update the progress value
  and see the progress bar adjust in real time.

### Step 5: Run Your Application

Start the development server to see your progress bar in action:

```bash
npm start
```

Open the application: Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You
should see a simple progress bar that updates its value as you move the range
slider.

### Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully built a reusable and responsive ProgressBar component in
React! This component is now ready to be integrated into any part of your
application where a progress indication is needed. Feel free to customize the
styles or enhance its functionality as needed.
